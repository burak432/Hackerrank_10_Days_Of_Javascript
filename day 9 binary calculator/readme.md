# Hackerrank - Day 9 Binary Calculator

* I listened "btns" div with an event listener for inputs, and then reflected them into the display screen.
* "btnEql" element does the job. I used a regex to listen which math operant is clicked.
* After btnEql clicked, it creates an array, which is splitted by operant into two numbers.
* And then it calculates and send result to the display screen.
* Im pretty sure there are much better ways of doing it, but for now this is the best solution i could come up with.
